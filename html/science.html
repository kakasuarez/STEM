        The "S" in STEM typically applies to natural sciences and formal
        sciences, the former including chemistry, biology, physics and
        environmental science, while the latter focuses more on mathematics and
        statistics. Science enables us to develop our interest in, and
        understanding of, the living, material and physical world and develop
        the skills of collaboration, research, critical enquiry,
        experimentation, exploration and discovery.

          APJ Abdul Kalam was an aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. He studied physics and aerospace
          engineering. He spent four decades as a scientist and science
          administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
          Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
          was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
          military missile development efforts.

          Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and
          astronomer widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and
          physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists.His
          book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica first published in
          1687 established classical mechanics. Newton formulated the laws of
          motion and universal gravitation. Newton used his mathematical
          description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion,
          account for tides, and the trajectories of comets.

          Galileo was an astronomer, physicist and engineer from Pisa, in
          modern-day Italy.Galileo has been called the "father" of observational
          astronomy, modern physics, the scientific method, and modern science.
          Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the
          principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in
          applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums
          and "hydrostatic balances". He invented the thermoscope and various
          military compasses.

        The Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates the conservation of
        momentum and the conservation of energy with swinging spheres. When one
        sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary
        spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes
        the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the
        nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite
        direction.
