        <h3>Timeline of mathematics</h3>
        <p><span class="name">Thales of Miletus (c. 624 – 546 BCE)</span><br />He is the first individual in history that has a mathematical discovery named after him: Thales’ theorem.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570 – 495 BCE)</span><br />He was a Greek philosopher and mathematician. He is best known for proving Pythagoras’ Theorem, but made many other mathematical and scientific discoveries.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Euclid of Alexandria (around 300 BCE)</span><br />He was a Greek mathematician and is often called the father of geometry. Euclid taught mathematics in Alexandria, but not much else is known about his life.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Archimedes (c. 287 – 212 BCE)</span><br /> While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged. He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out on the street, still undressed, yelling “Eureka!” (Greek for “I have found it!”).</p>
        <p><span class="name">Aryabhata (476 – 550)</span><br />He was one of the first mathematicians and astronomers in the golden age of Indian mathematics. He defined trigonometric functions, solved simultaneous quadratic equations, found approximations for \(\pi \), and realised that  \(\pi \) is irrational.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Bhaskara II (1114 – 1185)</span><br />He was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He discovered some of the basic concepts of calculus, more than 500 years before Leibnitz and Newton. Bhaskara also established that division by zero yields infinity, and solved various quadratic, cubic, quartic and Diophantine equations.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783)</span><br />He was one the greatest mathematicians in history.Euler invented much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, and made important discoveries in calculus, analysis, graph theory, physics, astronomy, and many other topics.</p>
        <p><span class="name">Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955)</span><br />At the age of 26, during his “miracle year”, he published four groundbreaking scientific papers that explained the photoelectric effect and Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and derived the formula  \(E = mc^2  \), which states that energy \(E\) and mass \(m\) are equivalent.</p>
