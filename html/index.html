                STEM is an abbreviation that stands for science, technology,
                engineering, and mathematics. It is an interdisciplinary
                approach to learning where academic concepts are coupled with
                real-world lessons. Students apply science, technology,
                engineering, and mathematics in contexts that make connections
                between the classroom and the world around them.

              <p>
                STEM is important because it teaches critical thinking skills
                and instills a passion for innovation. Beyond the benefit of
                learning science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM
                assists in the problem-solving and exploratory learning that
                fuel success across a variety of tasks and disciplines. We have
                seen initiatives intended to add more females and minorities to
                STEM fields.

              Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), NITI Aayog is Government of India’s
              flagship initiative to promote a culture of innovation and
              entrepreneurship in the country and was setup in 2016. Towards
              this end AIM has taken a holistic approach to ensure creation of a
              problem-solving innovative mindset in schools and creating an
              ecosystem of entrepreneurship in universities, research
              institutions, private and MSME sector. All the initiatives of AIM
              are currently monitored and managed systematically using real-time
              MIS systems and dynamic dashboards. AIM is also currently having
              its programs reviewed by third party agencies for ensuring
              continuous improvements.

            <p class="aim-text">
              Over the last 4 years, AIM has launched the Atal Tinkering Lab
              (ATL) program. ATL is a state-of-the-art space established in a
              school with a goal to foster curiosity and innovation in young
              minds, between grade 6th to 12th across the country through 21st
              century tools and technologies such as Internet of Things, 3D
              printing, rapid prototyping tools, robotics, miniaturized
              electronics, do-it-yourself kits and many more. The aim is to
              stimulate a problem-solving innovative mindset within the children
              of the ATL and nearby communities. Till date, AIM has selected
              10,000 schools in 680+ districts of the country for the
              establishment of ATLs. More than 7000 schools are funded till now
              and over 2 million students have access to ATLs.

            <h1>Why ATLs?</h1>
            <p class="aim-text">
              ATL is a workspace where young minds can give shape to their ideas
              through hands on do-it-yourself mode; and learn innovation skills.
              Young children will get a chance to work with tools and equipment
              to understand the concepts of STEM (Science, Technology,
              Engineering and Math). ATL would contain educational and learning
              ‘do it yourself’ kits and equipment on – science, electronics,
              robotics, open-source microcontroller boards, sensors and 3D
              printers and computers. Other desirable facilities include meeting
              rooms and video conferencing facility.
