            <p class="aim-text">
              The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and in order to make use of information stored, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol. This allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on <strong>January 1, 1983</strong>, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.
